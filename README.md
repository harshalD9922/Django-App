# Django-App
I have created a Django app to calculate the number of people infected in the country by covid-19 virus. I have use covid-19 API and integrate it into the project which can do real-time monitoring on active cases in the country and get updated.
you have to integrate an API in the Django app to the latest update of covid19 cases. After updating you have to create a UI interface to design the project.
Also, you have to install Django on your machine to run the project.
you can use the "pip install " command to install Django.
Also if required you have to install the request module package in the system.
